========================================

This project was created for the Thales Arduino Workshop & Contest at the University of Manchester

I have created a C# interface for the arduino. The arduino has a IR distance sensor, a servo, and an LDR (light sensor) 
attached to it. I managed to read the 3 pieces of data from the arduino using a serial cable and display them on the 
screen.
